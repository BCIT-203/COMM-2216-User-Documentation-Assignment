# Glossary

## Version Control System (VCS)

    A **Version Control System** is a tool used to track changes in files over time, especially in software development. It makes it easier for developers to collaborate and revert the source code.

## Distributed System

    A **Distributed System** refers to a system that has multiple copies available on different machines.

## Branching

    **Branching** allows developers to create separate lines of development within the same project. Branches are independent of each other, and changes can be merged into each other. Branching helps organize features, bug fixes, and experiments without affecting others.

## Merging

    **Merging** integrates changes from one branch into another, so that the entire team benefits from the updates.

## Commit

    A **Commit** is a set of changes made to the codebase. When a developer makes changes to files and saves them in Git, they can commit those changes with a message describing what was done. Each commit is uniquely identified by a hash and represents a point in the projectâ€™s history.

## Repository (Repo)

    A **Repository** contains all the files and the metadata (commit history, branches, etc.) that Git tracks. A repository can be local (on your machine) or remote (hosted on a server like GitHub or GitLab).

## Clone

    **Cloning** is the process of creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine. When you clone a repository, you get the entire project history, including all branches and commits, allowing you to work on the project locally.

## Push

    A **Push** is the action of sending your local commits to a remote repository, making your changes available to other team members. Pushing is essential for collaboration as it shares your progress with others and syncs your local changes with the remote version of the repository.

## Pull

    A **Pull** is a set of actions that fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local copy of the repository. It ensures that your local repository is up to date with the latest changes made by other contributors.

## Forking

    **Forking** allows you to make changes to the codebase of open-source projects independently, and later propose the changes (via a pull request) to be merged into the original project.

## Conflict

    A **Conflict** occurs when two developers make changes to the same file in the same branches and Git cannot automatically merge these changes. Therefore, the developer must manually resolve the conflict before proceeding.

## Checkout

    **Checkout** is a command used in Git to switch between different branches or commits.
