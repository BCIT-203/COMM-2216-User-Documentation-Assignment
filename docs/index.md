# Introduction

## Welcome to Git's World

**Git** is a distributed [version control system (VCS)](./9-glossary.md#version-control-system-vcs) that helps track changes to your codebase, collaborate with other developers, and maintain a history of your project. Whether you're working solo or with a team, Git is an essential tool for managing your source code efficiently.

## Key Features

1. **Version Control**: Git tracks every change made to a projectâ€™s codebase, allowing users to view a complete history of their project.
2. **[Branching](./9-glossary.md#branching) and [Merging](./9-glossary.md#merging)**: Git allows users to create branches (independent lines of development) for different features or fixes, which can later be merged back into the main codebase.
3. [**Distributed System**](./9-glossary.md#distributed-system): Every user has a full copy of the [repository](./9-glossary.md#repository-repo), making it possible to work offline and still have access to the entire project history.
4. **Collaboration**: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently, helping them merge their work and avoid conflicts.
5. **Code Integrity**: Git ensures that code remains consistent and protected from accidental changes by creating checkpoints ([commits](./9-glossary.md#commit)) and using checksums to verify data integrity.

## Intended Use

- **Software development**: Managing source code, version tracking, and collaborating in coding projects.
- **Team collaboration**: Helping developers coordinate, merge changes, and prevent code conflicts.
- **Open-source projects**: Facilitating contribution and community-driven development by enabling multiple contributors to work on the same codebase.
- **Backup and recovery**: Storing multiple versions of code to quickly revert or recover previous code states.

## Intended Readers

- **Software Developers**: Both novice and experienced developers who want to manage and collaborate on code projects efficiently.
- **DevOps Engineers**: Professionals who work on automating and managing software development pipelines.
- **Project Managers**: Individuals who oversee software development teams and need to understand version control and collaboration tools.
- **Open-Source Contributors**: Anyone looking to contribute to open-source projects, where Git is commonly used for version control.

By using Git, you'll be able to track your progress, collaborate effectively with your team, and ensure that your project is always in a stable state. Happy coding!
